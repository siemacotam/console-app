# HelloWorld - C# Practice Application

This project serves as a learning platform for practicing C# fundamentals and exploring various functionalities within the .NET ecosystem. The primary goal is to solidify core C# concepts through hands-on implementation and experimentation.

## Current Functionality

Currently, the application provides basic command-line interactions, including:

* User Management: Adding, listing, and (attempting) to remove users.
* Basic Math Operations: Performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on user-provided numbers.
* Listing Options: Displaying available commands to the user.
* Database Interaction (SQLite): Demonstrates basic connection to an SQLite database and operations like creating a table and listing cities.

## Planned Development

Future development aims to enrich the application with more advanced features and explore new areas of C# and .NET, including:

* Enhanced User Management: Implementing proper error handling for user removal, data persistence, and potentially user authentication.
* Expanding Math Operations: Adding more mathematical functions, input validation, and potentially handling different number types.
* Deeper Database Integration: Exploring more complex database operations, data querying, and potentially using an ORM like Entity Framework Core.
* Asynchronous Operations: Implementing asynchronous tasks for non-blocking operations, especially for I/O bound tasks like database access.
* Unit Testing: Introducing unit tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the implemented functionalities.
* Configuration Management: Learning to use configuration files for settings and connection strings.

## Learning and Development Approach

This project is driven by a desire to learn and grow as a C# developer. The approach involves:

* Practical Application: Implementing theoretical concepts learned through documentation and examples.
* Incremental Enhancement: Gradually adding new features and refactoring existing code for better design and efficiency.
* Experimentation: Trying out different C# features, libraries, and best practices.
* Continuous Learning: Utilizing resources like documentation, online tutorials, and community feedback to improve the application and coding skills.

Feel free to explore the code and follow along with the development!
